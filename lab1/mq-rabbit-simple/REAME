A project to help you understand encapsulation of resources and become accustom to configuring packages.
 
  1) Remember not everything is an RPM 
  2) Timing - how do you time the results of this example? 
     a) Consistent representation? Variance?
     b) Compare to the other lab examples?
  3) Weak scaling?
  4) There maybe some updating that needs to occur as the example is a bit dusty
  5) Have fun!

 

This project's goals are:
---------------------------------
 
 1) Install RabbitMQ and its dependencies
    a) http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html
 2) Configure a runtime environment
 3) Using Apache Ant
 4) Strategic thinking and planing for single process vs. multi-process design practices.


Installing (item 1):
---------------------------------

make install TARGET_DIR=[INSTALL_DIR]/server SBIN_DIR=[INSTALL_DIR]/sbin MAN_DIR=[INSTALL_DIR]/man DOC_INSTALL_DIR=[INSTALL_DIR]/doc


Testing (from the command line):
---------------------------------

1) Start with HelloTest
2) Next try the pub-sub example
3) Then when you got things working try MQPostFactoryTest
4) Lastly, try connecting to a another computer 


Organization (items 1 & 2):
---------------------------------

1) Think about how you organize your project and third party libraries.
2) Runtime - how do you organize your environment to promote stability?
3) How does your configuration support new version of libraries and binaries?
4) How does your runtime support a production and a development on the same node?


Patterns (item 4):
---------------------------------

1) Apply the circuit breaker pattern to the MQ example
